Hello friends this time I have developed a IC 555 based controller to control stepper motor
This controller can control speed as well as direction of stepper motor.
This small PCB based controller is very handy to test A4988 stepper driver IC and Stepper motors.
The main plus point of this controller is it does not required any coding.
Those of you have worked with stepper motor at any point of time 
they must know it is too much pain to run a stepper motor
Traditionally we need a microcontroller then we need a stepper driver IC then we need to write code to run stepper motor then we need to upload that code to our microcontroller.
All after this, we are able to run or stepper motor.
Suppose you just need to check your stepper motor or A4988 stepper driver or you need to 
run stepper motor for any simple application you have to go through traditional way
However, by using this controller simple just connect stepper motor wires and connect power supply to PCB 
that is it you are ready to go.
Further in this post we will learn in depth about how this controller work
